                    <i>By Jennifer Sellers, Petfinder contributor</i>
                    <p>When it comes to raising kittens, the philosophy is pretty similar to that of bringing up children. If
                        you provide proper care and training when they’re young, it increases the odds they’ll grow up to
                        be healthy, well-adjusted adults. So if you recently adopted a kitten, start incorporating this advice
                        as soon as possible.</p>

                    <div style="float: left;padding-left: 0;">

                        <span class="kitten-care-header"><b>Don’t Treat Your Kitten Like an Adult Cat</b></span>
                        <p>Just as a human infant has vastly different needs than a teenager, a kitten will have care requirements
                            distinct from those of a fully matured cat. In addition, you should consider a kitten’s various
                            stages of development when caring for her:<br>
                            <p class="kitten-care-bold_text">Under 8 weeks of age.</p>
                            <p>At this early age, a kitten should still be with her mother and litter mates. Because kittens
                                this young are unable to regulate their own temperatures, they rely on one-another’s body
                                heat to survive. In addition, they are still developing vision and leg coordination. If you
                                adopt or foster an orphan kitten in this age group, special care will need to be taken, including
                                bottle-feeding the kitten for every two hours up to four weeks of age and possibly helping
                                your kitten pee and poop. It’s best to consult with a veterinarian for specific instructions
                                and advice.</p>
                            <img src="site/img/kitten-growing1.jpg" alt="little kitten on hands" style="width:100%">
                            <p class="kitten-care-bold_text">8 - 11 weeks of age.</p>
                            <p> Kittens are usually weaned by eight weeks and should be eating kitten diet, which needs to be
                                energy dense, rich in protein and highly digestible. Whether choosing dry kibble or wet food,
                                be sure it is formulated for kittens. Other big changes will start occurring during this
                                period as well. As your kitten begins developing complex motor skills she will become a force
                                of nature — running, jumping, playing and exploring. This is a delightful period of kittenhood,
                                but also one that can be dangerous to your kitten if she isn’t appropriately supervised.
                                Start setting boundaries for your kitten and keep her in a safe, enclosed room while you
                                can supervise her.</p>
                            <p class="kitten-care-bold_text">2 - 4 months of age.</p>
                            <p> This is a phase of rapid growth for kittens in which they’ll have almost three times more energy
                                than an adult cat. They’ll need three to four individual meals a day during this time. According
                                to Vetstreet.com, these meals should be minimum 30 percent high-quality protein.</p>
                            <p class="kitten-care-bold_text">4 - 6 months of age.</p>
                            <p> Kittens in this age group are reaching adolescence and, thus, sexual maturity. Talk to a veterinarian
                                about having your kitten spayed or neutered before your kitten reaches this stage to avoid
                                unpleasant habits like territorial spraying and accidental litters. (Learn more about spaying
                                and neutering here.)</p>

                            <span class="kitten-care-ol">Reward Good Behavior and Socialize, Socialize, Socialize</span>

                            <p>The socialization and training your cat receives during kittenhood will affect how well she will
                                likely interact with people and other animals when she’s older. “I remember the first time
                                I fostered kittens and how worried I was about scaring them,” says Jane Harrell. “What I
                                didn’t know was that that was a critical socialization period for them and not exposing them
                                to things made them more nervous as adults. Now when I foster kittens I do everything I can
                                to get them exposed to as much as possible – loud noises, walking on leashes, strangers,
                                you name it! It all helps them become better-adjusted, healthy adult cats.” Just makre sure
                                your kittens have a positive experience out of any socialization exposure you provide them.
                                As a new kitten’s parent, it will be up to you to guide her and show her that the world is
                                a wonderful place. Consider trying some of these training and socialization methods:</p>

                                <li>Kittens will generally use litter boxes by instinct, however you can help teach her to use
                                    it by placing her in the box after meals and play sessions. Make sure the litter box
                                    is always available to your kitten and cleaned frequently</li>
                                <li>Pet her frequently</li>
                                <li>Get her used to weekly combing and grooming.</li>
                                <li>Introduce her to toys</li>
                                <li>Allow her to experience different walking surfaces (carpet, linoleum, etc.)</li>
                                <li>Take her outside on a lead or in her carrier (It can be very dangerous to allow a kitten
                                    outside without one.) However, before providing any outdoor exposure be sure your veterinarian
                                    has administered the proper vaccines and enough time has passed for your kitten to build
                                    immunity.
                                </li>
                                <li>Give her objects to explore, such as boxes and paper bags</li>
                                <li>Play loud music and make noise</li>
                                <li>Have friends over and ask them to play with her and give her treats</li>
                                <li>Provide appropriate scratching alternatives (such as scratching posts) and reward her with
                                    toys, praise or treats when she uses them</li>
                                <li>Do not allow her to bite or scratch during play. If she does, redirect her attention to a
                                    toy.
                                </li>

                                <li>Expose her to other cats and kittens (as soon as they’re up to date on vaccinations, of course!).
                                    There are even kitten socialization classes; do an internet search to see if any are
                                    available in your area.</li>
                                <li>Take your kitten on car rides, giving her treats the whole time, and get her used to her
                                    carrier. (Check out these tips for getting your cat to like his carrier.)</li>
                                <li>Reward friendly behavior with treats or praise.</li>
                                <li>Do not reprimand bad behavior, instead, ignore her when she displays inappropriate behavior.
                                    (Give her a time out.)</li>
                                <li>Challenge your kitten to think by teaching her tricks. (Learn how to teach a cat tricks.)</li>

                            <span class="kitten-care-header">Make Preventive Care a Priority</span>
                            <p>To help ensure your kitty has a lifetime of good health, start early in providing her with preventive
                                care:
                            </p>
                            <p class="kitten-care-bold_text">Schedule an appointment early.</p>
                            <p>No matter what, schedule your kitten’s first vet appointment within a week of getting her. Early
                                and frequent vet visits will help socialize your kitten with the vet and help the vet establish
                                a baseline for your kitten’s health.</p>
                            <p class="kitten-care-bold_text">Ask about intestinal parasites, fleas and heartworm.</p>
                            <p> Have a veterinarian check your kitten for worms and intestinal parasites, and have her de-wormed,
                                if necessary. And while heartworms aren’t as much of a problem for cats as they are for dogs,
                                some kittens may be susceptible, so also ask your vet if he or she recommends a heartworm
                                preventative. The biggest parasitic threat to your kitten, however, is fleas. You can start
                                administering topical flea preventatives when your kitten is around 8 to 12 weeks of age
                                — although some brands are formulated for kittens as young as 4 weeks old.</p>
                            <p class="kitten-care-bold_text">Ask which vaccinations your kitten needs and how often:</p>
                            <p>Preventive care for kittens may include vaccines for feline leukemia, rabies and distemper. These
                                shots are usually first administered when a kitten is around 8 weeks of age, with boosters
                                given every few weeks until she reaches 16 weeks of age. After that, your veterinarian can
                                set her up on an adult vaccination schedule. He or she may also recommend additional vaccinations.</p>
